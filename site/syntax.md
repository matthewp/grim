Grim syntax is inspired by [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/), and is mostly the same where possible. Grim adopts the double curly for bindings, {% raw %}`{{}}`{% endraw %}, as is common with dozens of template languages and is familiar to most.

Below are links to the various use-case and what syntax is used.
